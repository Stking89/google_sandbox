**Under Active Construction:**

This repository is currently undergoing significant structural changes. The existing code represents a quick deployment and is not yet reflective of the intended long-term architecture.

**Goals:**

- Develop a well-defined, modular Terraform codebase for improved reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
- Abstract resource configurations and logic for greater flexibility and adaptability.

**Current Status:**

- The codebase is functional but not optimized for modularity or abstraction.
- Architectural decisions are still under review to determine the best approach for module composition.

**Next Steps:**

- Define a clear architectural blueprint for modularization and abstraction.
- Refactor existing code to align with the new architecture.
- Create reusable Terraform modules for common components and resources.
- Implement improved testing and documentation practices.

 **Use with Caution:** 

Due to the ongoing reconstruction, exercise caution when using or modifying the code in this repository. Significant changes are anticipated in the near future.

**Stay Updated:**

- Watch this repository for updates on progress and changes.
- Feel free to contribute or provide feedback on the architectural direction.

**Updates**

    - Repository will be moved into personal GitHub orginization starting 1/9/24
